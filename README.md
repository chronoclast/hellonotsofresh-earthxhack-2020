  Hello(NotSo)Fresh

### By Team _"TexasTopf"_
 
_**Food waste? Nein danke!** A project by Emelie Hofland and Jaime Gonz√°lez-Arintero for the [EarthxHack](https://earthxhack.weareasterisk.com) online event, on April 24-26, 2020._

## Introduction

According to [recent studies](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/wasted-food-IP.pdf), **supermarkets throw away 43 billion pounds of food every year** and this is considering the U.S. alone. Grocery stores cause [10% of the U.S. foodwaste](https://www.dumpsters.com/blog/grocery-store-food-waste-statistics), making grocery store food waste a massive problem. 

_Hello(NotSo)Fresh_ is an initiative to avoid excessive grocery store food waste by promoting products that are still good but need to be sold rather sooner than later. To do this, it uses **sensor data** to keep track of how long food products have been in store. This way, we can make a **ranking of products that need to be sold** and products that are on deal to automatically **generate delicious recipes** that can be shown to the customers.

Another advantage is that people will get inspired to try out new dishes and ingredients, therefore also contributing to a more varied diet. 

Here is a screenshot of the _Hello(NotSo)Fresh_ application:

## Technical setup

### Supermarket sensors

A set of sensors have been installed in order to track the stock, and to detect when the products remain too long on the shelf. As a proof of concept, to simulate a shelf in a grocery store, a few products have been placed in wooden boxes.

In the absence of reliable weight sensors, and since this project has been fully implemented at home, **two alternative sensors have been used to detect if the products remain in the shelves**. 

The stock of one of the wooden boxes is tracked by means of an **ultrasonic distance sensor**, as shown below. When the box is full, the sensor will detect the objects in front of it, in this case the potatoes:

The stock of the wooden tray is tracked using a **luminance sensor**. When the tray is full, the luminosity measured by the sensor changes:

Mainly, two variables are being tracked for each product:

* The **"stock"** of the products: i.e. if the products in particular are still on stock
* The **"shelf time"**: this is, the time that the products have been on the shelves; the longer they remain unpurchased, the closer they will get to their _best before_ date; for the demo, the "shelf time" has been tracked in seconds, as a quick proof of concept

This measurements are sent to the [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com) platform using a ESP-32 development board, shown below.

![](assets/esp32-core-board-v2.jpg)

#### Requirements

* [ESP-32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32) development kit (or similar)
* [Ultrasonic distance sensor](https://www.parallax.com/product/28015)
* [Luminance sensor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Luminance-Sensor.html)
* Prototyping breadboard
* Connecting wires and USB cable
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
* [Adafruit IO Arduino library](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-adafruit-io/libraries)
* [ESP32 board support for Arduino](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/)

#### Setup

First of all, create a free account in [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com).

Then, install and configure the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software), and add the [support for ESP-32 boards](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/).

Proceed to open the `supermarket-sensors` Arduino project that can be found in the [`hardware`](/hardware) folder of this repository.

**NOTE:** Before flashing the project on the ESP-32 development kit, remember to **introduce your personal Adafruit IO credentials, as well as with the desired SSID and password for the WiFi** in the `config.h` file. An [example of how this is done](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io-basics-digital-input/arduino-network-config) is available in the Adafruit documentation.

The Arduino code ([`supermarket-sensors.ino`](hardware/supermarket-sensors/supermarket-sensors.ino)) has been heavily commented, and it should be easy to customize if needed.

The sensors must be connected to the ESP-32 according to the following tables.

```
ESP-32 DEVKIT      |       DISTANCE SENSOR
-------------------|----------------------
5V ----------------|------------------- 5V
GND ---------------|------------------ GND
IO0 (GPIO0) -------|------------------ SIG
```

```
ESP-32 DEVKIT      |      LUMINANCE SENSOR
-------------------|----------------------
3V3 ---------------|------------------ VCC
GND ---------------|------------------ GND
IO34 (GPIO34) -----|------------------ SIG
(Not Connected) ---|------------------- NC
```

For reference, the complete ESP-32 pinout can be found [here](assets/esp32-pinout-lowres.jpeg).

Once flashed, the device will start sending data to the Adafruit platform. You will be able to see the data feeds in the URL below: `https://io.adafruit.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/feeds`

For this project, an additional dashboard was created in the same platform, which can be found in [this link](https://io.adafruit.com/chronoclast/dashboards/hellonotsofresh?kiosk=true). Please note that the data may not be up to date, since the sensors need to be connected to publish measurements. A screenshot of the dashboard can be seen below, displaying the "shelf time" (i.e. how long each product has been on the supermarket without being purchased nor restocked).

![](assets/supermarket-adafruit-dashboard.jpg)

The R-Shiny application explained in the next section retrieves the sensor data by means of HTTP calls to the Adafruit API.

In this project implementation, the sensor data can be retrieved with simple `cURL` commands.

For the shelf in the **middle**:

    curl https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/chronoclast/feeds/time-middle

And the shelf in the **right**:

    curl https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/chronoclast/feeds/time-right

The key `"last_value"` stores the "shelf time" of each product.

Please note that when replicating this project, the user name in the URLs will be different, following the format: `https://io.adafruit.com/api/v2/{YOUR_USERNAME}/feeds/{YOUR_FEED_NAME}`

## Shiny application

The web application is build with R shiny. We have used the following resources inside the app:

* _"Sketchy"_ bootstrap.css from [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/sketchy/)
* Background picture by [Daria Yakovleva](https://pixabay.com/users/Daria-Yakovleva-3938704/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=1932466) from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/food-kitchen-cook-tomatoes-dish-1932466/) (free for commercial use)
* [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) for recipes, more specifically, we used the [`Search-Recipes-By-Ingredients`](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Search-Recipes-by-Ingredients) endpoints
* The [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com) API to query the sensor data (see [technical setup](#technical-setup) for the supermarkets sensors above)

### Links to the app

#### Dummy version

To showcase the app, we have uploaded a dummy version to shinyapps.io, with which the function of the app can be simulated.

The dummy app can be visited **[here](https://emelieh21.shinyapps.io/dummy-app/)** and the source code can be found in the [dummy-app](dummy-app) folder.

![image](assets/dummy-app.png)

The app is hosted on [shinyapps.io](shinyapps.io). To deploy the app, all that was needed was an account on shinyapps.io and running the following code:

*deploy_app.R*

```R
# deploy app
library(rsconnect)

# https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html
# You can get the needed info from https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/tokens
rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name='<USER_NAME>',
                          token='<TOKEN>',
                          secret='<SECRET>')

setwd('/path/to/dummy-app/')
deployApp()
```

#### Live version

For the live demo we will run the app **locally** in our flat, since it only makes sense to run the 'real-live' version when we are actually moving groceries around and have the sensors connected.

However, to showcase the full functionality of the actual application, we deployed it to shinyapps.io as well (see the [app](app) folder for source code), in **'demo' mode**. This means the sensor inputs are **simulated** and the recipe API is not called, instead a **recipe is randomly chosen** from a small selection.

This version of the app can be visited **[here](https://emelieh21.shinyapps.io/hello-not-so-fresh-demo-mode/)**. This link allows to see how the app functions with the **product table** that updates according to how long products are in store (products being removed or replaced is being simulated in the background) and the change it triggers in the displayed recipe.
